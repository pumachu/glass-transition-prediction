# Protocol for glass-transition temperature prediction
This is a repository for the paper:

**Kun-Han Lin**, Leanne Paterson, Falk May and **Denis Andrienko** Glass transition temperature prediction of disordered molecular solids, *submitted*

The contents will be introduced as following.

### INPUT_FILES
This folder contains input files for Gaussian (**GAUSSIAN/**), DDEC6 (**DDEC6/**) and Gromacs (**GROMACS/**) computations.
In **GROMACS** folder, there are three input files corresponding to the three steps in generating simulated amorphous morphology and cooling:   
```
a. Geometry optimizaion (em.mdp)  
b. Heating and compressing (heating.mdp)   
c. Cooling (cooling.mdp)   
```
### ANALYZING_SCRIPTS
This folder contains python scripts for Tg fitting and creating R<sup>2</sup>-Temperautre plots for various fitting ranges.  
**Usage for R2-T_plot.py:**  
```
python R2-T_plot.py energy.xvg
```
The input file *energy.xvg* is the Gromacs output that contains the information of density and temperautre. The output of the python script is the R<sup>2</sup>-Temperature plot for differnt fitting ranges as shown below:

**Usage for Tg_fit_plot.py:**  
```
python Tg_fit_plot.py energy.xvg
```
The output of the python script is the œÅ-Temperature plot and the fitted Tg using different fitting ranges:

```
python Tg_fit_plot.py energy.xvg
```

```
